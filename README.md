# Spotlight App for Diversity Cyber Council

## Summary
The Spotlight App Project is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of
nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a
centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact.
The App is meant to solve the following problems:
* The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps
of service and overall impact.

* The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier of
access to the people we aim to serve.
