## Business Goals
The Spotlight App is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits in order to address specific
needs within the communities we serve by leveraging a
centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact.
The App is meant to solve the following problems:
* The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps
  of service and overall impact.

* The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier of
  access to the people we aim to serve.

The main business objectives include:
1. Establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline that extends career equity to underrepresented demographics
2. Provide access to competent training programs that lead to direct employment opportunities
3. Provide a platform  for the purpose of enhancing visibility, support, and collaboration of nonprofits serving similar 
needs in the community



## Business Drivers
* Reduce the service gaps and impact generated across organizations by centralizing and providing support between non-profits
* Eliminate the access barrier to non-profit groups and their offerings in the communities we serve by providing a
centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact.
